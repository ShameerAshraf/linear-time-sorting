# not-linear-time-sorting
My algorithm for linear time sorting (not fully fleshed out, use at risk of universe collapsing in on itself).

For a sufficiently small sleep time delta, this may not be a joke of an algorithm. The sleep time delta cannot be so small (or the input size so large) that it interrupts the first loop that spawns the threads.
